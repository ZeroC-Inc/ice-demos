This demo is an iOS client for the [ZeroC Chat Demo][1]. It connects to a
single chat room, allowing you to chat with other chat room participants.

By default, the demo connects to the chat server hosted on demo.zeroc.com
through a WebSocket reverse proxy hosted on zeroc.com.

You may use any user name and password when connecting.
