This demo illustrates how to integrate Ice with a simple graphical
application.

The demo shows how to make:

  - Twoway invocations. This is the default mode for any remote
    invocation. A twoway invocation is not complete until a reply has
    been received from the server.

  - Oneway invocations. A oneway [oneway invocation][1] is complete as
    soon as the client has successfully sent the invocation. Oneway
    invocations may not return values or throw user exceptions.

  - Oneway batched invocations. See below for details on batching.

  - Datagram invocations. [Datagram invocations][2] use the udp transport,
    and as such have very minimal quality of service guarantees.
    Datagram invocations are always oneway.

  - Datagram batched invocations. See below for details on batching.

[Batching][3], which is only possible when using oneway or datagram
invocations, combines several Ice messages into a single physical
protocol message. Batching can result in higher throughput and smaller
physical messages due to less protocol overhead. Ice does not actually
send a batched message until it is flushed.

If you enable secure invocations, oneway and twoway operations are
sent using the [SSL transport][4]. It is not possible to secure datagram
invocations.

All invocations use asynchronous method invocations (AMI) or batch
invocations to avoid blocking the GUI thread and ensure a responsive
user experience.

This demo runs against any hello server, such as the [Swift
server](../../../Ice/hello).

### Timeouts

To test [timeouts][5] you can use the timeout slider to set an invocation
timeout in the client proxy and the delay slider to set a delayed response
in the server to cause a timeout.

### IceDiscovery

Instead of configuring the IP address for the server you can use
[IceDiscovery][6] to discover the server.

To enable IceDiscovery, touch the "Use IceDiscovery" button to switch it on.
You must run the hello server from the IceDiscovery/hello demo (such as the
[Swift server](../../../IceDiscovery/hello)) and ensure that the server
is listening on an accessible network interface.

See the README file of the IceDiscovery hello demo for more information on
how to start the server.
