This demo illustrates the use of Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI)
with a server that performs simple calculations and a client that can
call for the calculations without blocking.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```
./Build/server
```

In a second window, start the client:

```
./Build/client
```
