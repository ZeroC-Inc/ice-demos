This demo illustrates the use of [Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI)][1]
with a server that performs simple calculations and a client that can
call for the calculations without blocking.

To run the demo, first start the server:
```
server
```
In a separate window, start the client:
```
client
```

> With .NET 6, use instead:
> ```
> dotnet server.dll
> ```
> and
> ```
> dotnet client.dll
> ```
