A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a proxy
to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the [server call
back][1] into an object provided by the client as part of that invocation.

To run the demo, first start the server:
```
server
```
In a separate window, start the client:
```
client
```

> With .NET 6, use instead:
> ```
> dotnet server.dll
> ```
> and
> ```
> dotnet client.dll
> ```
