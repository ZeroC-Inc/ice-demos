This demo implements the simple filesystem application shown at the
end of the [client][1] and [server][2] C# mapping chapters.

To run the demo, first start the server:
```
dotnet run --project server\server.csproj
```

In a separate window, start the client:
```
dotnet run --project client\client.csproj
```
