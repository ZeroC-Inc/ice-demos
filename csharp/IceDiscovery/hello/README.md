This demo is the Ice hello world demo configured to use [IceDiscovery][1].

To run the demo, first start the server:
```
server
```
In a separate window, start the client:
```
client
```

> With .NET 6, use instead:
> ```
> dotnet server.dll
> ```
> and
> ```
> dotnet client.dll
> ```

To test [timeouts][2] you can use 'T' to set an invocation timeout on the
client proxy and 'P' to set a delayed response in the server to cause a
timeout.
