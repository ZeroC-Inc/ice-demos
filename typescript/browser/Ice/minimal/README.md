This demo is a minimal Ice "hello world" application. Each time the
client is run a "sayHello" invocation is sent to the server.

To run the demo, first you need to start an Ice minimal server from
another language mapping (Java, C++, C#, or Python). Please refer to
the README in the server subdirectory for more information on starting
the server. If you want to get started quickly, we recommend using the
Python server.

Note that this demo uses port 10000. If port 10000 is not available on your
machine, you need to edit both client and server to use a free port.

The demo also assumes the client and server are running on the same host.
To run the demo on separate hosts, edit the server to remove `-h localhost`
from the object adapter's endpoint, and edit the client to replace `localhost`
with the host name or IP address of the server.
