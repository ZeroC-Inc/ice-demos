A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
Ice.

To run the demo, first you need to start an Ice latency server from
another language mapping (Java, C++, C#, or Python). Please refer to
the README in the server subdirectory for more information on starting
the server. If you want to get started quickly, we recommend using the
Python server.
