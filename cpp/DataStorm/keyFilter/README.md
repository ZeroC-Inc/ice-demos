This demo illustrates the use of key filters. The reader uses the `_regex` predefined key filter. The reader will only
subscribe and receive samples for keys matching the regular expression provided on construction of the reader object.

To run the demo, start the writer:

```shell
writer
```

In a separate window, start the reader:

```shell
reader
```
