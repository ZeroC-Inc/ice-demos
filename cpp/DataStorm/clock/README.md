This demo illustrates how to implement a custom encoder and decoder for the
topic value type `chrono::system_clock::time_point`.

To run the demo, start the writer and specify the name of a city:
```
writer
```

In a separate window, start the reader:
```
reader
```

The reader will print the time sent by the writer. You can start multiple
writers and readers.
