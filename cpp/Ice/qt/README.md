This demo illustrates how to write a QT GUI application which invokes
ordinary (twoway) operations, as well as how to make [oneway][1],
[datagram][2], [secure][3], and [batched][4] invocations.

## Building the demo on Linux and macOS

### Prerequisites

The demo requires [QT 5 SDK][7].

### Building the demo

```
qmake
make
```

## Building the demo on Windows

### Prerequisites

The project requires the [Qt 5 SDK][7], [Qt Visual Studio Tools][5] and [Ice Builder for Visual
Studio][6] extensions.

**When installing Qt 5 SDK ensure you select the MSVC 2015 64-bit component**

### Building the demo

your Qt 5 Visual Studio 2015 Version, then use the `Change Solution's Qt Version`
option in the solution context menu to set the Qt version that will be used, once the Qt version
has been set you can build the solution.
