A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a proxy
to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the [server call
back][1] into an object provided by the client as part of that invocation.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```
server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

```
client
```
