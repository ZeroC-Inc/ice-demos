This demo is the Ice hello world demo configured to use [IceDiscovery][1].

To run the demo, first start the server:

```
server
```

In a separate window, start the client:

```
client
```

The client and server use IceDiscovery to enable the location of the
Ice hello object. See the config.server and config.client files for
details on the IceDiscovery configuration.
