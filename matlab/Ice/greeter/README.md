# Greeter

The Greeter demo illustrates how to write a client application with Ice for MATLAB.

Ice for MATLAB supports only client-side applications. As a result, you first need to start a Greeter server implemented
in a language with server-side support, such as Python, Java, or C#.

Then, in a separate window, run the client application:

```shell
client
```
