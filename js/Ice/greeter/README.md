# Greeter

The Greeter demo illustrates how to write a client application with Ice for JavaScript.

Ice for JavaScript supports only client-side applications. As a result, you first need to start a Greeter server implemented
in a language with server-side support, such as Python, Java, or C#.

You can build the client application with:
```shell
npm run build
```

- Run the client application

```shell
node client.js
```
