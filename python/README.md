# Python Demos

## Overview

This directory contains Python sample programs for various Ice components.
These examples are provided to get you started on using a particular Ice feature or
coding technique.

Most of the subdirectories here correspond directly to Ice components, such as
[Glacier2](./Glacier2), [IceGrid](./IceGrid), and so on. Note that [Manual](./Manual)
contains complete examples for some of the code snippets in the
[Ice manual][1].

Refer to the [C++ demos](../cpp) for more examples that use the Ice services.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install Ice for Python in order to use any of the sample programs.
Our [documentation][2] describes how to install the Python packages.

## Running the Demos

Refer to the README file in each demo directory for usage instructions.
