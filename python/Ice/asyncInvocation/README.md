This demo illustrates the use of [Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI)][1]
with a server that performs simple calculations and a client that can
call for the calculations without blocking. It requires Python 3.7 or
greater.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```
python3 server.py
```

In a second window, start the client:

```
python3 client.py
```
